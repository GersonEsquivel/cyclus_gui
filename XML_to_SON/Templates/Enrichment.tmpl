%The Enrichment facility is a simple agent that enriches natural uranium in a Cyclus simulation. It does not explicitly compute the physical enrichment process, rather it calculates the SWU required to convert an source uranium recipe (i.e. natural uranium) into a requested enriched recipe (i.e. 4% enriched uranium), given the natural uranium inventory constraint and its SWU capacity constraint.
%
%The Enrichment facility requests an input commodity and associated recipe whose quantity is its remaining inventory capacity.  All facilities trading the same input commodity (even with different recipes) will offer materials for trade.  The Enrichment facility accepts any input materials with enrichments less than its tails assay, as long as some U235 is present, and preference increases with U235 content.  If no U235 is present in the offered material, the trade preference is set to -1 and the material is not accepted.  Any material components other than U235 and U238 are sent directly to the tails buffer.
%
%The Enrichment facility will bid on any request for its output commodity up to the maximum allowed enrichment (if not specified, default is 100%) It bids on either the request quantity, or the maximum quanity allowed by its SWU constraint or natural uranium inventory, whichever is lower. If multiple output commodities with different enrichment levels are requested and the facility does not have the SWU or quantity capacity to meet all requests, the requests are fully, then partially filled in unspecified but repeatable order.
%
%Accumulated tails inventory is offered for trading as a specifiable output commodity.
